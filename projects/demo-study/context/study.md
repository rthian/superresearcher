## Business Objective

Understand customer pain points and opportunities in the mobile banking app experience to inform Q1 2026 product roadmap priorities.

**Key Decisions This Research Will Inform:**
- Should we redesign the account opening flow?
- What are the top 3 features to build in Q1 2026?
- How do we improve our app store rating from 3.8 to 4.5+?
- Which customer segments are most frustrated and why?

2. How do customers currently manage their finances, and where does our app fit in their workflow?
3. What features or improvements would most significantly increase daily active usage?
4. What barriers prevent customers from completing key actions (account opening, fund transfer, bill payment)?
5. How does our app compare to competitor banking apps in customer perception?
6. What drives customers to contact support, and could those issues be prevented through better UX?
