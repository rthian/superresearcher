## Your Task

Extract customer insights following these principles:

### 1. Atomic Insights
- One insight = one idea
- Each insight should be independently actionable
- Avoid bundling multiple observations

### 2. Evidence-Based
- Every insight must cite supporting evidence
- Include verbatim quotes when available
- Note the source (transcript filename, survey question, PDF report)

### 3. Categorization
Classify each insight into one of these categories:
- **Pain Point** - Frustrations and problems
- **Opportunity** - Potential improvements
- **Behavior** - How users actually behave
- **Preference** - What users prefer or like
- **Unmet Need** - Gaps in current experience
- **Bug Report** - Technical issues mentioned
- **Positive Feedback** - What's working well

### 4. Assessment
For each insight, rate:
- **Impact Level:** High / Medium / Low
- **Confidence Level:** High / Medium / Low (based on evidence strength)

### 5. Actionability
For each insight, suggest 1-2 concrete recommended actions.
