probably the worst e banking app I have used so far. The app makes money transfer so difficult that after I answered your security questions, still it says it's not permitted. I'm not even transferring to a completely new account. it feels the so called security features just want to lock my momey without my consent.

The issue with the app nagging you to disable developer option on every startup is fixed. However, any function that requires 2FA (such as viewing debit card number) won't work unless developer option is off. No other banking apps do this.

Applied for credit a month ago but still can't use it after a month. The app has issues. I called and was told to wait for an update (dont know by when). Very disappointing.

GXS bank is not honest and transparent. My paynow was blocked as it was "under review". They are unable to tell me how long it will be under review for and for what reasons. My husband encountered the same issue and his account was closed down shortly after. They did not provide any valid reason stated that they are unable to disclose. Hello? This is my account with my money inside. Why am I not entitled to know the reason? How can anyone feel safe with their money inside.

Keep telling you to disable Developer Option. Inform once is enough.

transfer was blocked due to security issue. called into the customer service and was advised to transfer money out to another bank and do my transaction there. upon transferring money out to another bank account to fulfill my banking needs. my account was blocked for 12 hours due to security reasons. upon calling the customer service helpline, the lady was rude and said nothing could be done. my only option was to wait 12 hours before I could do any banking. absolutely horrible

Blocks usage if developer mode is enabled. No other local bank app has this requirement. Ease of use is a big factor, the decision to implement such a block is big enough to have me reconsider using this bank.

Stop asking me to disable developer options. Other banking apps don't ask this either.

UPDATE : Still havent received email regarding acct closure. UPDATE 12.5.25 So i basically told them to close the account & **** off. Their incompetence is costing me money. They froze my account since 6th April 2025 stating "Periodic Review" nonsense. So yes they are responsible for costing me my money. Thanks for nothin GXS. TrustBankSg is wwwaayyy wwaayy much better & has more features available. Essential & useful feature than this turd of a so called digital bank

Suddenly logged out of my account and had to re-login via Singpass. This triggered the 12h cooling off period and I was unable to transfer out my funds... Though funds remain safe, the impact on liquidity may cause issues (e.g. miss large bill payments). Customer support mentioned that there was no way to lift the cooling off period and my funds were entirely locked during this 12h period. After testing out various amounts, I was only able to transfer out $1000 once and not a single $ more.
