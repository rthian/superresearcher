It is a good all in one app I must say but one thing I am unhappy about is the debit card because you can't paywave much using nets and sometimes I can't even use it on the mrt so it defeats the purpose of actually having the debit card . Has alot of issues with the pay thru via Mastercard even when I add it to Gpay . Hope they sort it out

it's annoying to sign up for their flexicard... received an edm from my school email stating that students above 21 can sign up with no minimum income, but when I tried signing up, it just kept rejecting me even with 5 tries on different devices. I personally own DBS & Maybank student cc, and have never experienced such a poor experience with their competitors.

UPDATED 10.4.25 : So they suspended my incoming trf feature & placed it under review back in march2025. outgoing trf still ok. cust svc told me will get bck with results within a month. See if my savs acct theres alot of incoming & outgoing & just by that its flagged for money laundering..dont claim oh it can be used for everday usage. its stupid misleading.
