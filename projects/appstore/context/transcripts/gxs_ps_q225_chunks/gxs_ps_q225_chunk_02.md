Probably the worst e-wallet among all. Transfer in money no problem. But to use the card to pay and for all transfer out, it's impossible. And to sum it up, the customer service will listen and no action to resolve the issue. Seriously a joke of a app.

3 min approval is a blatant lie - can take hours, and days. customer service staff are incompetent, Gen-Zs. Staff named Jieyi even sighed at one point - my fucking bad its my first time on GXS and I am not familiar with how it works. Hope you appropriately discipline this person, otherwise you risk losing customers.

Take note of hidden withdrawal limit by bank that overwrites your own set daily limit. If you want to try to open the account and put in funds to try out, note that there is a 10k daily hidden withdrawal limit for 14 days that the bank set which other banks doesnt. You will need to call in and wait for their support to lift the hidden limit.

Everything was great, especially the cashback and the savings jar, until my account was suddenly unable to use while I was overseas. Fortunately, I had my WISE card with me as a backup. Imagine being stranded without funds while abroad, with no notification about the issue. For me, that's unacceptable and a major red flag. As soon as I returned to Singapore, I quickly closed my account and decided to forget this unreliable bank. 💩

Installed this app multiple times and it does not allow smooth login on mobile data and on Wifi. It also does not connect to my DBS account properly.

Easy to use. Auto log out if I forget to log out. I get Cashback for certain purchases using it. Help me to save emergency funds too. Quite a good digital banking app.
