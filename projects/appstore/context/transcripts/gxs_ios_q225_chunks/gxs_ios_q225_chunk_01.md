Verbatim: Interest rates going down

Been using GXS for the past 1year and all has been well until recently updated and realised the interest rates have gone from 2.8% to 2.08% to NOW 1.98% 

It is so ridiculous. I dont intent to continue using GXS anymore after this.

Verbatim: They hold money hostage

Unable to withdraw money, transfer limit is pretty much a gimmick, take note if you are intending to transfer a large sum into the account, you are guaranteed to have a hard time to take out the aforementioned sum, proceed at your own risk.

Verbatim: Integration with Apple Pay only thing left to make it great

The UI/UX is miles ahead of the bigger incumbents tbh and I really like the savings pockets feature, which also has higher interest. As of now, the debit card cannot be added to Apple Wallet / Apple Pay yet though.

Verbatim: Money trapper and withdrawal disabled

You’ve been warned. My funds is trapped for more than 24 hours  and after going through 6 customer services (they  are all incompetent) , there is still no result. Becareful. I’ve already made a report to Monetary Authority of Singapore

Verbatim: complicated and gimmicky

Created a basic account looks ok.  Then when exploring the so called boost pockets aka term deposit, so many pockets to choose is confusing.  Why need to create so many pockets for different reasons why not just straight forward put fixed deposit 3 month or 6 month?
What’s difference between the main account and savings pockets and boost pockets?  Main acc is not savings acc?  Boost pockets different from term deposit?

Verbatim: Account blocked for no apparent reason

The account was locked for no apparent reasons. Support online chats and calls to the service centre yielded more frustration. One of the worst digital banks compared to the rest.

Verbatim: Getting bad as time goes

It was amazing at first, however, as time goes, they keep on lowering the interest from initially 2.98 to 2.38 to NOW 1.98% 

Its ridiculous. Not as good as before already.

Verbatim: Another top down Grab attitude

Setting phone security PIN isn’t it my own rights and freedom? Why must your app dictate what I need to do personally? Typical kiasu attitude. Other banks respect the users but not you Grab!👎

Verbatim: How to exit the screen

Application submitted, said can exit the screen while waiting for the review.  There’s nowhere I see any x to exit, only the bottom page read FAQ.  Tap on that brings me to FAQ screen, done and back to that screen asking me to exit.  How?
