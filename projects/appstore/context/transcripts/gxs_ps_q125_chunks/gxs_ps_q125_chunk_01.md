After an update, totally can't transfer money into the account. Tried linking bank also no option to select banks at all, no bank name showing. Failed badly and losing public confidence, sad to say. Please work on testing properly prior to updates please. Please resolve issue ASAP.

just blocks your account without informing. say under review then ONE MONTH later then can put in funds. AND THEY CANT TELL YOU WHEN IS THE END OF THIS REVIEW. WOW ... IF I COULD GIVE NEGATIVE STARS, I WOULD.

Grab merchant di indonesia nggak perlu pakai aplikasi ini pakai ovo dan superbank sudah mantap dan bisa jelas dipahami dan diterima.. Sebaiknya dihapus nggak ada manfaatnya..

If you're a SME in singapore, I highly discouraged the use of its biz account for many reasons: 1. Difficulty in receiving and sending payment Need to pay CPF? Sorry. It has no paynow function to pay others (just receive money) Not listed as a bank that can send fast payment 2. Poor UE The home page is flooded with notices from Gxs that may not be useful. 3. Problematic customer support They don't help at all. Buggy like hell. Can just hold money😔

The only one bank cannot be trust with their service. One day u all money will stuck in acc cannot withdraw or transfer n they cannot solve or not take a serious action with this. They wanna manipulate the customer money. My money stuck in they still cannot solve the problem after 3 week. Never trust this bank.. We cannot do anything they dont have office for we go through and complain about. The customer service is all AI robot answer

The WORST BANK in Singapore will suddenly block you from applying for loan even if you have an active account with them and no bad record they will say it's part of their review....BE CAREFUL if you want to open account with them

For no reason my account was closed, 3 weeks later i received an email stating there was a transaction made from my gxs whereby my account and debit card was already terminated 3 weeks ago. I was told to allow them 2 days to check while i had already helped them to clear half of their job by calling the merchant.
