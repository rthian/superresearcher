Generally I like this app, but recently I can't link my bank account any more. No bank account options show up and it just shows error. Please fix this and I'll change my review!!

Transactions delay. Customer services just close chat session directly after reply without confirming whether the issue has been resolved

What a ridiculous bank, even if you transfer $1 via paynow, they require you to key in passcode! They close ticket without providing any aids, think carefully if it's safe to bank with an operation that cannot get their act together.

I can't link my account. When I keep trying to select which bank to link, that particular page does not have any option popping up and when I try to type the bank name it just shows blank a page.

7 days after eGIRO service became unavailable customer service kept replying there is no information on what was the issue and when it will get restored. On the 8th day customer service replied work is ongoing. eGIRO used to be a great feature but it was disrupted suddenly. It has already been 8 days but the bank is sharing no info. It's hard not to think that they are in serious trouble.

If they don't like a company, they'll block everyone from sending it to them and give you a lie about "transaction seems sus. wait 12 hours. " Even if you waited days, that wouldn't change anything. Even support themselves said that. And if you ever asked them why, they'll just keep saying, "You can't transfer to that company. You can withdraw your funds to other banks.", same scripted response again and again. How childish is your company?

1/5 stars - Unreliable Banking Experience GXS Bank's handling of disputed charges is extremely disappointing. They fail to resolve issues with merchants, instead providing vague options. They also ignore requests for explanations on why cases are closed, leaving customers with no answers. Many, including myself, have escalated complaints to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). If you're considering banking with GXS, be aware of their inadequate dispute resolution process.

For months since November 2024 unable to apply loan due to wrong order of app setup and customer service do not know when can be resolve. This is really digital banking or not sure what they doing?

Too clever for its own good at identifying screen sharing apps, and doesn't even tell me which app is causing it, just "Unidentified Threat"

Customer service sucks. Transfers out $500 at 540 am and now it's 630 pm. No response over chat or hotline, forever engaged. Do not park your monies with them!!!
