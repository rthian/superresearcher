Verbatim: Ummmm

Can’t use on Apple pay in this day and age. The rewards are also disappointing. The promotional messaging suggests that scratch cards up to $10 cashback are given, but the actual rewards are underwhelming. Most rewards apps typically offer at least $0.10 to $1, while GXS scratch cards average at like literally $0.02 lol

Verbatim: Savings promo are a scam

Entered into a 3 mth savings promo via boost savings pocket. When I enquired why I did not receive any reward. Bank cited that I did not meet eligibility criteria as funds were withdrawn too soon. No where in the terms was it stated that funds needed to be held till 2359 on the day of holding period end at the point of promo.

Verbatim: Good but Can be better

Love the GXS Interface , Easy to use and see everything at a glance! What i would like or many people would agree is to be able to sign up for the GXS FlexiLoan as well as the card or at least allow to withdraw from the Flexicard and Join the loan instead at a 1 time free no cost conversion

Verbatim: Hold account without notifying user

My account was suddenly blocked and I couldn’t transfer any funds. The app said to call them to rectify the issue and when I did, all I got was that my account was under review for an investigation. There was no notification that they will hold my account and my money is trapped in the account and I can’t do anything with it. They won’t share any information on why they are doing this and that they cannot help me solve this issue. 

They told me I had to wait for 2-4 WEEKS! For an email from the team. 

This is ridiculous! I’ve never heard such bank which will hold your account and not inform you. 

I will not be recommending this app, it was such a horrific experience and shocking to me.

Very nice digital bank but it would be better if you can be more creative with the app. Sorry to say the app is boring and black

Verbatim: Having issues accessing boost pocket savings etc

Honestly it’s been a great digital bank but lately I can’t access my boost pockets no matter how much I click into them I can log into my account but can’t access my savings so what’s the point??? I have to keep deleting the app and re-downloading it simply to look at my balance/ boost pockets it’s very inconvenient, please resolve this issue soon.

Verbatim: withdrawal cash

gxs is undoubtedly one of the best banks you can use for either personal use or even business purposes in my opinion. the features such as “pockets” has helped me manage my money well and it’s easy to open one “pocket” w this feature i now can easily separate my money for different purposes but one thing they need to do is being able to deposit cash into the bank or take out cash it would make the bank easily one of the best banks out there if this cash deposits feature was a thing. it would have a major impact in today world as there still plenty of places that sadly only accept cash. but gxs will definitely be the bank i’ll ask my friends to use in the future due it it’s many features and this features make banking so much easier compared to other banks

Verbatim: Horrible Security Protocols and Terrible Customer Service

Bank has very low security protocol. I had a fraudulent on my card and the way they handle it was highly unacceptable. Wait times are also long and committed to get back to you, they never make their promises timelines. I’ve used other prepaid/debit cards like YouBiz, YouTrip and when there was an authorised transaction, they resolved it well. GXS does not value customers safety when it comes to transaction. With so many choices, rather one choose others.

Verbatim: Doesn’t work like a bank

If it takes weeks to fix fund transfers error in the platform I am not sure if it can be relied and trusted upon as a digital bank

Verbatim: Lousy Bank

Don’t bother to use this bank. Can’t fully get back your money for unauthorised transactions like most banks do. Asked me to lodge a police report which i did but it doesn’t help either.

Verbatim: Change of age limit

This is not good at all because it doesn’t allow those over 55 years of age. It should let those who are over 55 years of age.
