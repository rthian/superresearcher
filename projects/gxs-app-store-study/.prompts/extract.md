> Can’t use on Apple pay in this day and age. The rewards are also disappointing. The promotional messaging suggests that scratch cards up to $10 cashback are given, but the actual rewards are underwhelming. Most rewards apps typically offer at least $0.10 to $1, while GXS scratch cards average at like literally $0.02 lol

**Subject:** Hold account without notifying user  
> My account was suddenly blocked and I couldn’t transfer any funds. The app said to call them to rectify the issue and when I did, all I got was that my account was under review for an investigation. There was no notification that they will hold my account and my money is trapped in the account and I can’t do anything with it. They won’t share any information on why they are doing this and that they cannot help me solve this issue. 

They told me I had to wait for 2-4 WEEKS! For an email from the team. 

This is ridiculous! I’ve never heard such bank which will hold your account and not inform you. 

I will not be recommending this app, it was such a horrific experience and shocking to me.

> gxs is undoubtedly one of the best banks you can use for either personal use or even business purposes in my opinion. the features such as “pockets” has helped me manage my money well and it’s easy to open one “pocket” w this feature i now can easily separate my money for different purposes but one thing they need to do is being able to deposit cash into the bank or take out cash it would make the bank easily one of the best banks out there if this cash deposits feature was a thing. it would have a major impact in today world as there still plenty of places that sadly only accept cash. but gxs will definitely be the bank i’ll ask my friends to use in the future due it it’s many features and this features make banking so much easier compared to other banks

**Subject:** Horrible Security Protocols and Terrible Customer Service  
> Bank has very low security protocol. I had a fraudulent on my card and the way they handle it was highly unacceptable. Wait times are also long and committed to get back to you, they never make their promises timelines. I’ve used other prepaid/debit cards like YouBiz, YouTrip and when there was an authorised transaction, they resolved it well. GXS does not value customers safety when it comes to transaction. With so many choices, rather one choose others.

It has no paynow function to pay others (just receive money) Not listed as a bank that can send fast payment 2. Poor UE The home page is flooded with notices from Gxs that may not be useful. 3. Problematic customer support They don't help at all. Buggy like hell. Can just hold money😔

On the 8th day customer service replied work is ongoing. eGIRO used to be a great feature but it was disrupted suddenly. It has already been 8 days but the bank is sharing no info. It's hard not to think that they are in serious trouble.

You can withdraw your funds to other banks.", same scripted response again and again. How childish is your company?

> 1/5 stars - Unreliable Banking Experience GXS Bank's handling of disputed charges is extremely disappointing. They fail to resolve issues with merchants, instead providing vague options. They also ignore requests for explanations on why cases are closed, leaving customers with no answers. Many, including myself, have escalated complaints to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). If you're considering banking with GXS, be aware of their inadequate dispute resolution process.

> probably the worst e banking app I have used so far. The app makes money transfer so difficult that after I answered your security questions, still it says it's not permitted. I'm not even transferring to a completely new account. it feels the so called security features just want to lock my momey without my consent.

My husband encountered the same issue and his account was closed down shortly after. They did not provide any valid reason stated that they are unable to disclose. Hello? This is my account with my money inside. Why am I not entitled to know the reason? How can anyone feel safe with their money inside.

Though funds remain safe, the impact on liquidity may cause issues (e.g. miss large bill payments). Customer support mentioned that there was no way to lift the cooling off period and my funds were entirely locked during this 12h period. After testing out various amounts, I was only able to transfer out $1000 once and not a single $ more.

> Take note of hidden withdrawal limit by bank that overwrites your own set daily limit. If you want to try to open the account and put in funds to try out, note that there is a 10k daily hidden withdrawal limit for 14 days that the bank set which other banks doesnt. You will need to call in and wait for their support to lift the hidden limit.

Imagine being stranded without funds while abroad, with no notification about the issue. For me, that's unacceptable and a major red flag. As soon as I returned to Singapore, I quickly closed my account and decided to forget this unreliable bank. 💩

The hotline you mentioned is always busy. I don't have time to wait for 20 mins just to not connect with a human. 2. Your app has issues not just with eGIRO. I have a 1 min video of the GXS not being able to connect to SingPass.

Has alot of issues with the pay thru via Mastercard even when I add it to Gpay . Hope they sort it out

### Survey Data
No survey data available.

---

## Your Task

Extract customer insights following these principles:

### 1. Atomic Insights
- One insight = one idea
- Each insight should be independently actionable
- Avoid bundling multiple observations

### 2. Evidence-Based
- Every insight must cite supporting evidence
- Include verbatim quotes when available
- Note the source (transcript filename, survey question)

### 3. Categorization
Classify each insight into one of these categories:
- **Pain Point** - Frustrations and problems
- **Opportunity** - Potential improvements
- **Behavior** - How users actually behave
- **Preference** - What users prefer or like
- **Unmet Need** - Gaps in current experience
- **Bug Report** - Technical issues mentioned
- **Positive Feedback** - What's working well

### 4. Assessment
For each insight, rate:
- **Impact Level:** High / Medium / Low
- **Confidence Level:** High / Medium / Low (based on evidence strength)

### 5. Actionability
For each insight, suggest 1-2 concrete recommended actions.
