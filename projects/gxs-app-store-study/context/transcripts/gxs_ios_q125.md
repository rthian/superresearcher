**Subject:** Ummmm  
> Can’t use on Apple pay in this day and age. The rewards are also disappointing. The promotional messaging suggests that scratch cards up to $10 cashback are given, but the actual rewards are underwhelming. Most rewards apps typically offer at least $0.10 to $1, while GXS scratch cards average at like literally $0.02 lol

**Subject:** Savings promo are a scam  
> Entered into a 3 mth savings promo via boost savings pocket. When I enquired why I did not receive any reward. Bank cited that I did not meet eligibility criteria as funds were withdrawn too soon. No where in the terms was it stated that funds needed to be held till 2359 on the day of holding period end at the point of promo.

**Subject:** Good but Can be better  
> Love the GXS Interface , Easy to use and see everything at a glance! What i would like or many people would agree is to be able to sign up for the GXS FlexiLoan as well as the card or at least allow to withdraw from the Flexicard and Join the loan instead at a 1 time free no cost conversion

**Subject:** Hold account without notifying user  
> My account was suddenly blocked and I couldn’t transfer any funds. The app said to call them to rectify the issue and when I did, all I got was that my account was under review for an investigation. There was no notification that they will hold my account and my money is trapped in the account and I can’t do anything with it. They won’t share any information on why they are doing this and that they cannot help me solve this issue. 

They told me I had to wait for 2-4 WEEKS! For an email from the team. 

This is ridiculous! I’ve never heard such bank which will hold your account and not inform you. 

I will not be recommending this app, it was such a horrific experience and shocking to me.

**Subject:** withdrawal cash  
> gxs is undoubtedly one of the best banks you can use for either personal use or even business purposes in my opinion. the features such as “pockets” has helped me manage my money well and it’s easy to open one “pocket” w this feature i now can easily separate my money for different purposes but one thing they need to do is being able to deposit cash into the bank or take out cash it would make the bank easily one of the best banks out there if this cash deposits feature was a thing. it would have a major impact in today world as there still plenty of places that sadly only accept cash. but gxs will definitely be the bank i’ll ask my friends to use in the future due it it’s many features and this features make banking so much easier compared to other banks

**Subject:** Horrible Security Protocols and Terrible Customer Service  
> Bank has very low security protocol. I had a fraudulent on my card and the way they handle it was highly unacceptable. Wait times are also long and committed to get back to you, they never make their promises timelines. I’ve used other prepaid/debit cards like YouBiz, YouTrip and when there was an authorised transaction, they resolved it well. GXS does not value customers safety when it comes to transaction. With so many choices, rather one choose others.
