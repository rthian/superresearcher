**Subject:** They hold money hostage  
> Unable to withdraw money, transfer limit is pretty much a gimmick, take note if you are intending to transfer a large sum into the account, you are guaranteed to have a hard time to take out the aforementioned sum, proceed at your own risk.

**Subject:** Integration with Apple Pay only thing left to make it great  
> The UI/UX is miles ahead of the bigger incumbents tbh and I really like the savings pockets feature, which also has higher interest. As of now, the debit card cannot be added to Apple Wallet / Apple Pay yet though.

**Subject:** complicated and gimmicky  
> Created a basic account looks ok.  Then when exploring the so called boost pockets aka term deposit, so many pockets to choose is confusing.  Why need to create so many pockets for different reasons why not just straight forward put fixed deposit 3 month or 6 month?
What’s difference between the main account and savings pockets and boost pockets?  Main acc is not savings acc?  Boost pockets different from term deposit?
