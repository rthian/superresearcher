> If you're a SME in singapore, I highly discouraged the use of its biz account for many reasons: 1. Difficulty in receiving and sending payment Need to pay CPF? Sorry. It has no paynow function to pay others (just receive money) Not listed as a bank that can send fast payment 2. Poor UE The home page is flooded with notices from Gxs that may not be useful. 3. Problematic customer support They don't help at all. Buggy like hell. Can just hold money😔

> For no reason my account was closed, 3 weeks later i received an email stating there was a transaction made from my gxs whereby my account and debit card was already terminated 3 weeks ago. I was told to allow them 2 days to check while i had already helped them to clear half of their job by calling the merchant.

On the 8th day customer service replied work is ongoing. eGIRO used to be a great feature but it was disrupted suddenly. It has already been 8 days but the bank is sharing no info. It's hard not to think that they are in serious trouble.

" Even if you waited days, that wouldn't change anything. Even support themselves said that. And if you ever asked them why, they'll just keep saying, "You can't transfer to that company. You can withdraw your funds to other banks.", same scripted response again and again. How childish is your company?

> 1/5 stars - Unreliable Banking Experience GXS Bank's handling of disputed charges is extremely disappointing. They fail to resolve issues with merchants, instead providing vague options. They also ignore requests for explanations on why cases are closed, leaving customers with no answers. Many, including myself, have escalated complaints to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). If you're considering banking with GXS, be aware of their inadequate dispute resolution process.
