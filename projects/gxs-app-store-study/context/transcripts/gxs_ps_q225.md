> probably the worst e banking app I have used so far. The app makes money transfer so difficult that after I answered your security questions, still it says it's not permitted. I'm not even transferring to a completely new account. it feels the so called security features just want to lock my momey without my consent.

My husband encountered the same issue and his account was closed down shortly after. They did not provide any valid reason stated that they are unable to disclose. Hello? This is my account with my money inside. Why am I not entitled to know the reason? How can anyone feel safe with their money inside.

> Suddenly logged out of my account and had to re-login via Singpass. This triggered the 12h cooling off period and I was unable to transfer out my funds... Though funds remain safe, the impact on liquidity may cause issues (e.g. miss large bill payments). Customer support mentioned that there was no way to lift the cooling off period and my funds were entirely locked during this 12h period. After testing out various amounts, I was only able to transfer out $1000 once and not a single $ more.

> Probably the worst e-wallet among all. Transfer in money no problem. But to use the card to pay and for all transfer out, it's impossible. And to sum it up, the customer service will listen and no action to resolve the issue. Seriously a joke of a app.

If you want to try to open the account and put in funds to try out, note that there is a 10k daily hidden withdrawal limit for 14 days that the bank set which other banks doesnt. You will need to call in and wait for their support to lift the hidden limit.

As soon as I returned to Singapore, I quickly closed my account and decided to forget this unreliable bank. 💩
