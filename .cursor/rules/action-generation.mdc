# Action Generation Rules

When converting insights into action items, follow these guidelines:

## Action Item Principles

### 1. Verb-Oriented Titles
Always start action titles with an action verb:
- ✅ "Implement reminder notifications for subscription renewals"
- ✅ "Research competitor onboarding flows"
- ✅ "Fix layout bug on mobile checkout"
- ❌ "Subscription reminder notifications"
- ❌ "Competitor research needed"

### 2. The 5W1H Test
Every action description should answer:
- **Who** - Which team/role owns this?
- **What** - What specifically needs to be done?
- **Why** - What insight/problem drives this?
- **When** - What's the timeline/urgency?
- **Where** - What product area/platform?
- **How** - What approach or method?

### 3. Measurable Success Metrics
Define how to measure completion:
- ✅ "Reduce support tickets about billing by 30%"
- ✅ "Achieve 4.0+ rating in onboarding survey"
- ✅ "Decrease time-to-first-value from 15 min to 5 min"
- ❌ "Users are happier"
- ❌ "Better experience"

## Priority Matrix

| Impact ↓ / Effort → | Small (<1 week) | Medium (1-4 weeks) | Large (1+ months) |
|---------------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **High Impact**     | 🚨 Critical     | 🔴 High            | 🔴 High           |
| **Medium Impact**   | 🔴 High         | 🟡 Medium          | 🟡 Medium         |
| **Low Impact**      | 🟡 Medium       | 🟢 Low             | 🟢 Low            |

## Department Assignment Guide

| Insight Type | Primary Department | Secondary |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Technical bugs | Engineering | Support |
| UX friction | Design | Product |
| Missing features | Product | Engineering |
| Pricing concerns | Executive | Marketing |
| Documentation gaps | Support | Product |
| Brand perception | Marketing | Executive |
| Sales objections | Sales | Product |

## Example Transformation

### From Insight:
```json
{
  "title": "Users struggle to find export function",
  "category": "Pain Point",
  "impactLevel": "Medium",
  "evidence": "6 of 10 users looked in Settings before finding Export in toolbar"
}
```

### To Action:
```json
{
  "title": "Add export shortcut to right-click context menu",
  "description": "Users currently struggle to find the export function (6/10 looked in Settings first). Add export option to right-click context menu on data tables and also consider adding keyboard shortcut (Cmd+E).",
  "priority": "Medium",
  "department": "Design",
  "effort": "Small",
  "impact": "Medium",
  "successMetrics": "Reduce 'where is export' support tickets by 50%. Track export discovery time in usability tests.",
  "sourceInsight": "insight-export-discovery",
  "status": "Not Started"
}
```

## Grouping Related Actions

When multiple insights point to the same solution, create one comprehensive action:

### Multiple Insights:
1. "Users forget to save before navigating away"
2. "Lost work is top complaint in feedback"
3. "Users manually save excessively out of fear"

### Single Action:
```json
{
  "title": "Implement auto-save with visual indicator",
  "description": "Multiple research findings show users are anxious about losing work. Implement auto-save every 30 seconds with clear visual feedback showing save status. Include 'last saved' timestamp.",
  "sourceInsight": "insight-save-anxiety, insight-lost-work, insight-manual-save"
}
```

## Avoiding Over-Scoping

❌ **Too Broad:** "Redesign the entire onboarding experience"
✅ **Focused:** "Add progress indicator to onboarding wizard"

❌ **Too Vague:** "Improve mobile experience"  
✅ **Specific:** "Optimize checkout form for thumb-zone accessibility on mobile"

❌ **Multiple Actions Bundled:** "Add notifications, improve settings, and update dashboard"
✅ **Atomic:** One action per discrete change
