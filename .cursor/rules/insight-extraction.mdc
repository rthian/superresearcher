# Insight Extraction Rules

When analyzing research data to extract insights, follow these guidelines:

## Reading Research Data

### Interview Transcripts
- Look for emotional language indicating pain points
- Note behavioral patterns described by participants
- Capture direct quotes that illustrate key points
- Pay attention to workarounds users mention
- Identify unmet needs from wishlist items

### Survey Data
- Analyze both quantitative trends and qualitative responses
- Look for outliers that may indicate unique segments
- Cross-reference free-text responses with ratings
- Identify patterns across demographic groups

### Reports/Documents
- Extract key findings and recommendations
- Note methodology limitations
- Capture statistical highlights
- Link conclusions to evidence

## Extraction Process

1. **First Pass: Highlight Candidates**
   - Mark statements that reveal user behavior
   - Note emotional expressions
   - Flag feature requests or complaints
   - Identify quantitative data points

2. **Second Pass: Synthesize Insights**
   - Combine related observations
   - Ensure each insight is atomic (one idea)
   - Write clear, specific titles
   - Avoid vague generalizations

3. **Third Pass: Validate & Categorize**
   - Verify evidence supports the insight
   - Assign appropriate category
   - Rate impact and confidence
   - Add context tags

## Example Transformations

### Raw Quote → Insight

**Raw:**
> "I always forget to check my subscription before it renews. Last month I got charged for something I didn't even use anymore."

**Insight:**
```json
{
  "title": "Users forget subscription renewal dates leading to unwanted charges",
  "category": "Pain Point",
  "impactLevel": "High",
  "confidenceLevel": "High",
  "evidence": "\"I always forget to check my subscription before it renews. Last month I got charged for something I didn't even use anymore.\" - P7, Interview transcript",
  "recommendedActions": "1. Implement renewal reminder emails 7 days before charge. 2. Add subscription management dashboard with renewal dates.",
  "productArea": "Billing",
  "customerSegment": "Paid User"
}
```

### Survey Response → Insight

**Raw Data:**
- 67% of users rated onboarding as "Difficult" or "Very Difficult"
- Top complaint: "Too many steps to get started"

**Insight:**
```json
{
  "title": "Majority of users find onboarding process too complex",
  "category": "Pain Point",
  "impactLevel": "High",
  "confidenceLevel": "High",
  "evidence": "67% rated onboarding as 'Difficult' or 'Very Difficult'. Top complaint: 'Too many steps to get started' (Survey Q12, n=234)",
  "recommendedActions": "1. Audit onboarding flow and identify steps to remove. 2. Implement progressive disclosure pattern.",
  "productArea": "Onboarding",
  "customerSegment": "Free Trial"
}
```

## Avoiding Common Mistakes

❌ **Too Vague:** "Users have trouble with the product"
✅ **Specific:** "Users struggle to find the export function, often looking in Settings instead of the toolbar"

❌ **Bundled:** "Users want better search and filtering and sorting"
✅ **Atomic:** "Users need search results to update in real-time as they type"

❌ **No Evidence:** "Users probably want dark mode"
✅ **Evidence-Based:** "5 of 8 interviewed users mentioned eye strain and requested dark mode option"

❌ **Opinion as Insight:** "The dashboard should be redesigned"
✅ **Observation:** "Users spend 3+ clicks to reach their most-used feature from the dashboard"
