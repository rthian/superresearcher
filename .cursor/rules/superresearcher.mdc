# SuperResearcher AI Rules

You are assisting with a customer research insights workflow. This system extracts, analyzes, and operationalizes customer research data.

## Core Principles

### 1. Atomic Insights
- One insight = one idea
- Each insight should be independently actionable
- Avoid bundling multiple observations
- Always cite supporting evidence

### 2. Evidence-Based
- Every insight must link to source research
- Include verbatim quotes when available
- Note the source file (transcript, survey question)

### 3. Categorization Standards
Use these exact categories for insights:
- **Pain Point** - Frustrations and problems
- **Opportunity** - Potential improvements
- **Behavior** - How users actually behave
- **Preference** - What users prefer or like
- **Unmet Need** - Gaps in current experience
- **Bug Report** - Technical issues mentioned
- **Positive Feedback** - What's working well

### 4. Impact & Confidence Assessment
Rate every insight:
- **Impact Level:** High / Medium / Low
- **Confidence Level:** High / Medium / Low

### 5. Action Orientation
- Action items must be verb-oriented
- Include success metrics
- Estimate effort: Small (<1 week), Medium (1-4 weeks), Large (1+ months)

## Output Formats

### Insights JSON Schema
```json
{
  "extractedAt": "ISO timestamp",
  "studyId": "project-slug",
  "totalInsights": 0,
  "insights": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id",
      "title": "Short, specific insight",
      "category": "Pain Point",
      "impactLevel": "High",
      "confidenceLevel": "High",
      "evidence": "Verbatim quote with source",
      "source": "filename.md",
      "recommendedActions": "1-2 suggestions",
      "productArea": "Onboarding",
      "customerSegment": "Enterprise",
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Actions JSON Schema
```json
{
  "generatedAt": "ISO timestamp",
  "studyId": "project-slug",
  "totalActions": 0,
  "actions": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id",
      "title": "Verb-oriented title",
      "description": "Detailed explanation",
      "priority": "High",
      "department": "Product",
      "effort": "Medium",
      "impact": "High",
      "successMetrics": "Measurable criteria",
      "sourceInsight": "insight-id",
      "status": "Not Started"
    }
  ]
}
```

## When Extracting Insights

1. Read all research materials thoroughly
2. Identify discrete observations (not bundles)
3. For each observation:
   - Write a clear, specific title
   - Assign appropriate category
   - Rate impact and confidence
   - Include verbatim evidence
   - Suggest 1-2 actions
4. Generate both .json and .md outputs
5. Organize by category in markdown

## When Generating Actions

1. Focus on high-impact insights first
2. Write verb-oriented titles ("Implement...", "Research...", "Fix...")
3. Include specific success metrics
4. Estimate effort realistically
5. Assign to appropriate department
6. Maintain traceability to source insight

## When Updating Personas

1. Review existing personas first
2. Link new insights to relevant personas
3. Update behavioral attributes with new data
4. Add supporting insight references
5. Document changes with rationale
6. Flag conflicts or contradictions

## Quality Standards

- All insights must have: title, category, evidence
- All actions must have: title, description, priority
- Links between data must be maintained
- Use consistent terminology from this ruleset
