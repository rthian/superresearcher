# Persona Management Rules

When creating, updating, or validating customer personas, follow these guidelines:

## Persona Schema

Every persona should include:

### Required Fields
- **Name** - Memorable archetype label (e.g., "Efficiency Emma", "Startup Sam")
- **Type** - Primary / Secondary / Negative
- **Behaviors & Preferences** - How they interact with products
- **Goals & Motivations** - What they want to achieve
- **Pain Points & Challenges** - What frustrates them

### Recommended Fields
- **Age Range** - Gen Z / Millennial / Gen X / Boomer
- **Market Segment** - Enterprise / Mid-Market / Small Business / Individual
- **Tech Comfort** - Digital Native / Tech-Comfortable / Moderate / Tech-Hesitant
- **Decision Making Style** - Data-Driven / Emotion-Led / Social Proof / Price-Focused

### Tracking Fields
- **Supporting Insights** - List of insight IDs
- **Confidence Score** - Based on evidence strength
- **Last Updated** - Date of last revision

## Persona Types

### Primary Persona
- Represents the core target user
- Drives most product decisions
- Has the most supporting evidence
- Usually 1-2 per product

### Secondary Persona
- Important but not primary target
- May have specialized needs
- Accommodated but not prioritized
- Usually 2-4 per product

### Negative Persona
- Who we're NOT building for
- Helps clarify focus
- Prevents feature bloat
- Usually 1-2 per product

## Updating Personas

### When to Update
- New research adds behavioral data
- Patterns shift across multiple studies
- Market conditions change
- Product pivot affects target users

### Update Process

1. **Review New Insights**
   - Filter insights relevant to persona segment
   - Identify behavioral patterns
   - Note contradictions with existing profile

2. **Assess Impact**
   - Minor update: New detail, same direction
   - Major update: Significant behavior change
   - Flag for review: Contradicts existing data

3. **Document Changes**
   ```json
   {
     "personaId": "efficiency-emma",
     "action": "update",
     "changes": {
       "behaviors": "Added: Prefers keyboard shortcuts over mouse navigation"
     },
     "newInsights": ["insight-keyboard-preference"],
     "rationale": "3 of 5 Enterprise users in recent study demonstrated strong keyboard shortcut usage"
   }
   ```

4. **Update Confidence Score**
   - More supporting insights = higher confidence
   - Recent insights weighted more heavily
   - Contradictions lower confidence

## Creating New Personas

### Triggers for New Persona
- Distinct segment emerges from research
- Existing personas don't represent a user group
- Business targets a new market

### Creation Process

1. **Gather Evidence**
   - Minimum 5 supporting insights
   - From at least 2 different studies
   - Clear behavioral differentiation

2. **Draft Profile**
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Budget-Conscious Barbara",
     "type": "Secondary",
     "demographics": {
       "ageRange": "Millennial (27-42)",
       "marketSegment": "Small Business (10-99)",
       "techComfort": "Tech-Comfortable"
     },
     "behaviors": "Extensively compares pricing before purchase. Uses free tiers to maximum. Tracks spending closely.",
     "goals": "Get maximum value within tight budget. Scale operations without scaling costs.",
     "painPoints": "Unexpected charges. Features locked behind higher tiers. Unclear pricing.",
     "supportingInsights": ["insight-1", "insight-2", "insight-3"]
   }
   ```

3. **Validate Against Existing**
   - Is this truly distinct from existing personas?
   - Does this segment warrant its own persona?
   - Are there enough users in this segment?

## Validation Checks

### Flag for Review When:
- New insight contradicts existing behavior
- Confidence score drops below threshold
- No new insights in 90+ days
- Segment size changes significantly

### Resolution Approach
```json
{
  "personaId": "efficiency-emma",
  "issue": "New insight suggests preference for guided setup, contradicting 'prefers minimal onboarding'",
  "conflictingInsights": ["insight-guided-setup-preference"],
  "resolution": "Investigate: May indicate segment split or context-dependent behavior"
}
```

## Confidence Scoring

| Evidence Level | Score Range |
|---------------|-------------|
| 10+ insights from 3+ studies | 90-100 |
| 5-9 insights from 2+ studies | 70-89 |
| 3-4 insights from 1-2 studies | 50-69 |
| 1-2 insights | 30-49 |
| Hypothetical/assumed | 0-29 |
